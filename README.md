## Description

After an introductory time with React, this project was a weekend challenge to create a photo gallery! This app is able to add likes to images and, when each image is clicked, displays a description for the picture.

## Built With

- CSS
- HTML5
- Javascript
- React
- Axios
- Node
- Material UI

## Getting Started

I spent most of this time familiarizing myself with the concept of "props" in React, and passing items between different components. I mapped out what components needed to be created and what props would be passing through. 

### Prerequisites

- git init
- npm install
- npm install express
- npm install nodemon --global
- npm install 
- npm install @mui/material
- npm install @mui/icons-material
- npm run server 
- npm run client (in a separate terminal)

### Installation

- import axios (helps with server routes)
- get data from the server 
- store server data in App.jsx via a GET call
- import useEffect (helps with running certain calls when the page is loaded)
- update document to make axios call when the page loads (using useEffect)


## Usage

You can use this project to display a number of images on the DOM with the capability to like and view description per image. 

This was a great project to help me familiarize myself with the basic functions of React and utilizing propsâ€”and I hope it can serve the same purpose for you, too!
